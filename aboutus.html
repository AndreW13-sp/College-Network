          <h3>Our story</h3>
          <p>Welcome to College Network Connection (CN), your Number One or you can say the Only One source for your useful stuff &
          needs whether it may be your private academic Learning Management System (LMS), or Social Media Platform. We're
          dedicated to providing you the very best of the LMS + Social Media platform, with an emphasis on accessibility,
          interactivity, versatility, etc.</p>
          <p>Founded in 2021 by the CN team, College Network Connection (CN) aims to go a long way from its beginnings. When the CN
          team first started to look for students as they were lacking a good platform or interface where they would easily manage
          their resources and can have some fun, it drove them to create a platform for students by combining the academic LMS and
          the social media, creating something valuable for them. As the whole idea is for the benefit of the students, the
          website will continue to be free without charging a single cent for all of them who want to use it according to their
          needs.</p>
          <p>We hope you enjoy our products as much as we enjoy offering them to you. If you have any questions or suggestions,
          please don't hesitate to mail from the respective section and we thank all the student's community for being our
          inspiration there.</p>
          <p>Sincerely,</p>
          <p>CN Team</p>
